VRO is based on [EMA](https://github.com/carmabs/ema), an Android MVI architecture, developed by [carmabs](https://github.com/carmabs).
# üë®‚Äçüíª Welcome to VRO 
Vro is a framework architecture, based on a MVI architecture and focused on the use of States, fully created to keep a full clean architecture and to make the creation of Android projects easier. 

# :rocket: First Steps 
Implement the VRO dependency directly to your project using Jitpack repository.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
Add VRO compose dependency to your presentation project module (Android Jetpack Compose Project):
```gradle
//Using libs.version file:
vro-compose = { group = "com.github.devaro95.vro", name = "vro-compose", version.ref = "vroVersion" }

//Using old mode:
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.devaro95:vro-compose:{$VROVersion}")
}
```
Add VRO core dependency to your core project module:
```gradle
//Using libs.version file:
vro-core = { group = "com.github.devaro95.vro", name = "vro-core", version.ref = "vroVersion" }

//Using old mode:
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.devaro95:vro-core:{$VROVersion}")
}
```
